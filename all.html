            <h3>Fear and Hunger</h3>

            <p> I recently had the pleasure of playing a neat little indie game by the name of <em>Fear and Hunger</em>. The game was made by a solo developer on the easily accessible <em>RPG Maker MV</em> engine, making it the very definition of “indie”. Set in the dank dungeon of a ruined fort, filled with mystery and intrigue, the game cultivates a very particular atmosphere. Enemies and traps lie around nearly every corner, while the music and sound effects add wonderfully to the feeling of dread as you explore. The game is also brutally difficult and punishing, meaning you will need to think carefully and weigh whether a room is worth the risk of exploring. This is balanced well against the mystique of the game's writing, which leaves you wanting to grasp at every snippet of lore and leave no stone unturned. Thus the game leaves you walking the edge between the fear of defeat and the temptation of finding answers.</p>
            <p> The game takes about 25 hours to complete, meaning it does not overstay its welcome. The combat is clearly reminiscent of old school JRPGs&mdash;most likely a limitation of using the <em>RPG Maker</em> engine. However, the game adds a fresh touch to the age-old, turn-based combat by allowing you to target specific body parts on an enemy. These parts can be severed or damaged and can dramatically impact the flow of combat encounters. Severing an arm can cause the enemy to lose an attack, while destroying the enemy&apos;s head can lead to an instant kill. In one particularly gruesome example, destroying an enemy&apos;s genitals leads to it becoming enraged and making the fight much more difficult. The same rules of combat apply to your party of character&apos;s as well, and losing an arm early can spell disaster for your playthrough.</p>
            <p> Overall the game is a refreshing twist on a classic system with a very strong reliance on atmosphere and writing. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a unique experience of grim eldritch horror and suspense.</p>

            <p> Before there were souls-likes there was <em>King&apos;s Field</em>. A game by From Software that went on to become a series in its own right, and paved the way for its successors: <em>Demon Souls</em> and the eventual <em>Dark Souls</em> trilogy that would define a sub-genre. While going back and playing the original <em>King&apos;s Field</em> may feel antiquated given that it released in 1994, there are things that made the game special. Like the souls games that would come after it, it cultivated a very special atmosphere: wondrous but aloof, unsettling yet enthralling. Furthermore, the old <em>King&apos;s Field</em> series was played in first person, in stark contrast to the souls-likes of today.</p>
            <p> <em>Lunacid</em> seeks to recapture for a modern audience what made <em>King&apos;s Field</em> special. Plumbing the depths of ancient and forgotten ruins in first person, with few hints to guide you, and even fewer NPCs to aid you. The game takes you across an astonishing breadth of environs, each one distinct and filled with secrets. In fact, there are so many secrets that I doubt they have all been found as of the time of this writing!</p>
            <p> If you are looking for a game to sit down with and explore, then few games do it so well as <em>Lunacid</em></p>

            <h3>Lisa: The Painful RPG</h3>
            <address class="author">Dylan VanBocxlaer</address>
            <time datetime="2025-06-01" title="June 01, 2025">June 01, 2025</time>

            </div>
            <p> Few games deal with tragedy as deep as that of <em>Lisa: The Painful RPG</em>. Fewer still do it with a healthy dose of comedy at the same time. <em>Lisa: The Painful RPG</em> takes place in a post-apocalyptic world in which all women have been wiped from the face of the earth. Only men live in the wasteland that once was civilization, mutants and gangs abound as the last remnants of humanity slowly die out. Yet hope is found when one day our protagonist, Brad Armstrong, finds a baby girl alone in a ravine and vows to protect her. </p>
            <p> The game forces you to make diabolically hard choices in order to protect the girl: will you sacrifice an arm, or let her be maimed? Now that you are missing your good hand, how much harder will it be to protect her in the future? Brad is also trying his best to give up on the hard drug called Joy, but it also gives him heightened combat senses when he indulges. Will you relapse to protect the girl? What other consequences will the drug abuse hold?</p>
            <p> Luckily the world of <em>Lisa: The Painful RPG</em> can also be uplifting, and often downright hilarious. You will meet a diverse and colorful cast of characters like Terry Hintz who is completely useless in battle, but offers equally useless hints! If that isn't your speed you can recruit Ajeet Mandeep, who for some reason can fire deadly lasers from his fingertips. Of course, if you care about these side characters you will have to be careful to protect them as well...</p>

            <h3>Dark Deity 2</h3>

            <p> <em>Dark Deity 2</em> is a triumphant return to classic Strategy RPG&apos;s. For fans of old-school Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics titles, this game is sure to please! It provides a surprising amount of depth in both its character interactions and gameplay.</p>
            <p> Much like contemporary Fire Emblem titles, units are given a unique personal skill that helps to distinguish them from their compatriots. It is extremely fun to find which classes best suit each character&apos;s personal skill.</p>
            <p> The cast is smaller when compared to similar titles, however this ends up being a strength rather than a weakness. The units are allowed to be much more diverse while also being tight-knit. Units rarely need to fight for a spot on the team, because each fills such a unique role.</p>
            <p>Another benefit of the smaller cast is that the side characters are allowed more screen time. Each character has a very engaging personality that comes across easily in their story interactions as well as in their bevy of support conversations with one another.</p>
            <p>If you are looking for a tactical RPG to sink a couple of weeks into then look no further than <em>Dark Deity 2</em>, as it also offers a whole slew of modifiers to make each playthrough unique.</p>
