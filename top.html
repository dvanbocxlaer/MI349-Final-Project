            <p> Few games deal with tragedy as deep as that of <em>Lisa: The Painful RPG</em>. Fewer still do it with a healthy dose of comedy at the same time. <em>Lisa: The Painful RPG</em> takes place in a post-apocalyptic world in which all women have been wiped from the face of the earth. Only men live in the wasteland that once was civilization, mutants and gangs abound as the last remnants of humanity slowly die out. Yet hope is found when one day our protagonist, Brad Armstrong, finds a baby girl alone in a ravine and vows to protect her. </p>
            <p> The game forces you to make diabolically hard choices in order to protect the girl: will you sacrifice an arm, or let her be maimed? Now that you are missing your good hand, how much harder will it be to protect her in the future? Brad is also trying his best to give up on the hard drug called Joy, but it also gives him heightened combat senses when he indulges. Will you relapse to protect the girl? What other consequences will the drug abuse hold?</p>
            <p> Luckily the world of <em>Lisa: The Painful RPG</em> can also be uplifting, and often downright hilarious. You will meet a diverse and colorful cast of characters like Terry Hintz who is completely useless in battle, but offers equally useless hints! If that isn't your speed you can recruit Ajeet Mandeep, who for some reason can fire deadly lasers from his fingertips. Of course, if you care about these side characters you will have to be careful to protect them as well...</p>
