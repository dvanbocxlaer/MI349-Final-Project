            <p> Before there were souls-likes there was <em>King&apos;s Field</em>. A game by From Software that went on to become a series in its own right, and paved the way for its successors: <em>Demon Souls</em> and the eventual <em>Dark Souls</em> trilogy that would define a sub-genre. While going back and playing the original <em>King&apos;s Field</em> may feel antiquated given that it released in 1994, there are things that made the game special. Like the souls games that would come after it, it cultivated a very special atmosphere: wondrous but aloof, unsettling yet enthralling. Furthermore, the old <em>King&apos;s Field</em> series was played in first person, in stark contrast to the souls-likes of today.</p>
            <p> <em>Lunacid</em> seeks to recapture for a modern audience what made <em>King&apos;s Field</em> special. Plumbing the depths of ancient and forgotten ruins in first person, with few hints to guide you, and even fewer NPCs to aid you. The game takes you across an astonishing breadth of environs, each one distinct and filled with secrets. In fact, there are so many secrets that I doubt they have all been found as of the time of this writing!</p>
            <p> If you are looking for a game to sit down with and explore, then few games do it so well as <em>Lunacid</em></p>
